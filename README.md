# fluid-tabs-demo
Demo of a new CSS UI component for the Covid-19 project

This component works similar to traditional tabs in that only one section of the component is available at a time. The user switches to an alternative section by clicking on a visual identifier for the content.

This project is still in the early phases and need to gather feedback for wrapping it into a Vue Component or something similar. Please visit the [demo](https://reptile18.github.io/fluid-tabs-demo/) and give feedback via the Issues tab.
